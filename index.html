      <h1>I'm sorry, Anup ðŸ’—</h1>
      <p>
        My dearest love, last night weighs heavily on my heart, and I am
        consumed with regret for raising my hand. There are no words sufficient
        to express how profoundly sorry I am for that moment, and for any fear
        or hurt I may have caused you. Please know that it was a terrible
        mistake, one I am deeply ashamed of, and it in no way reflects the
        infinite love and care I have for you. You mean everything to me, more
        than words can ever convey, and the thought of causing you any pain
        breaks my heart.<br /> My love for you is boundless, truly infinite, and I
        will do everything in my power to earn back your trust and ensure you
        always feel safe, cherished, and unconditionally loved with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, I know, I was a little mean last night... I wasn't thinking
        straight at the time and didn't realize it would bother you. But I
        should have been more careful. I really appreciate you thinking of me
        last night, and I'm really, really, really sorry for making you feel
        bad. I know I come across as a bitch sometimes, but I don't mean to be
        that way with you at all.
        <br />
        I promise to be nicer... at least until the next time I do something
        stupid without meaning to
      </p>
